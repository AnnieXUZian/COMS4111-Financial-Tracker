# Financial-Tracker

Our application is a Personal Finance Tracker that helps users manage their income, expenses, and budgets across multiple accounts.

The main entities include Users, Accounts, Transactions, Categories, and Budgets. Users can create accounts such as (savings or checking) and log transactions, categorized as credit and debit. Moreover, Users can choose the sub-categories for transactions, such as food or transportation for debit. If the user wants to reach some saving goals, they can also set a budget for a specific period and will get an alert when the limit is approaching.

The application will also provide real-time spending summaries within daily, monthly, and yearly timeframes. These summaries include:

Daily Spending Overview: A snapshot of all transactions made, categorized by type (e.g., income, expense) and specific categories (e.g., food, transportation).

Spending Summary: Insights into spending across each category and account.

Financial Summary: Trends in income and expenditure, including comparisons with previous years.

The challenging part of this project includes budget tracking and delivering insightful financial reports to users.
